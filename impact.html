							<h1>Our impact.</h1>
							<h3>ðŸ“– Hear what participants from our 2019 Paris Pilot Social Innovation Programme have to say about our us.</h3>

							<p>Claire W.</p>
							<blockquote>I joined SIC (Social Innovation Club) because I found that the club had the potential to create a real difference in our community.</blockquote>

							<hr />
							<p>Aya F.</p>
							<blockquote>I joined Social Innovation Club as I truly believe that even though we are high school students, we have the resources and capability to genuinely create a difference. Social Innovation Club has helped me develop marketing and advertising skills through the social media campaign, as well as leadership skills within my own group. </blockquote>

							<hr />
							<p>Misha S.</p>
							<blockquote>I joined SIC to solve social problems through technology. I felt like this could be very interesting. From SIC, I learned how to achieve something important as a group by putting together our strengths. </blockquote>

							<hr />
							<p>Alice D.</p>
							<blockquote>I joined SIC because when hearing of the project I found that it was a good mix between programing and technology and helping others. I felt like this was a project I could help in and enjoy working on. Going into SIC I had already some basic HTML skills, but it has allowed me to learn more and get more comfortable with the language, as well as having introduced me to bootstrap, which I now use whenever coding. </blockquote>

							<hr />
							<p>Ellie L.</p>
							<blockquote>Working in the club has helped me learn what goes into start up organizations, how they work. as well as working successfully with my peers.</blockquote>							

							<hr />
							<p>Lawson S.</p>
							<blockquote>Social Innovation Club helped me cultivate a more developed international understanding of different cultures and stories and a more intense appreciation of individuality and unity.</blockquote>

							<hr />
							<p>Anna K.</p>
							<blockquote>During SIC, I have learned how to create a project in order to solve a social issue. This skill actually helped me quite a lot when creating my own club called Koh-Ed. As one of the main representatives of Ko-Ed, I have been partnering up with SIC (Intrinsic) to help organise the Hackathon which is where we will be teaching basic coding, entrepreneurship, and how to create their own club in which they aim to solve a social issue.</blockquote>
